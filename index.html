                <p>The strong antioxidant capacity of berries is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease,
                    cancer and other inflammatory conditions. Berries may also be effective in treating various
                    digestive and immune-related disorders when used alongside traditional medical therapies. Some
                    of the most common berries include:</p>
                <p>Women who eat about two servings of strawberries or one serving of blueberries a week experienced
                    less mental decline over time than peers who went without these nutrition powerhouses, research
                    published in the Annals of Neurology found. In the study, researchers reviewed data from 16,010
                    women over age 70. Those with the highest berry intake postponed cognitive decline by about two
                    and
                    a half years. “We think that the effect might be related to a class of compounds called
                    anthocyanidins, which is a type of flavonoid," explains study author Elizabeth Devore, ScD, an
                    associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical
                    School
                    in Boston. "These compounds, found almost exclusively in berries, are known to cross the
                    blood-brain
                    barrier and locate in learning and memory centers in the brain."</p>
                <p>Berries are sweet, but not the kind of sweet that should send people with diabetes running.
                    “Because
                    they come with fiber, they can use that in a diabetic diet as a serving of fruit,” Copperman
                    says.
                    In general, it’s better to eat fruit whole rather than drink juice, which is much higher in
                    sugar
                    and doesn’t contain fiber. And even though the health benefits of berries still count when they
                    are
                    included in another food, the nutrition boost is better when you choose fresh blueberries over a
                    blueberry pie or a muffin.</p>

                <p>Whether you enjoy them as part of your breakfast, as a dessert, on a salad or in a smoothie, the
                    health benefits of berries are as versatile as their culinary applications. There are two
                    specific
                    types of berries that characterize certain taxonomic groups. The leathery-rinded berry of citrus
                    fruits (genus Citrus) is called a hesperidium. The elongated tough-skinned fruits of the family
                    Cucurbitaceae, including watermelons, cucumbers, and gourds, are a type of berry referred to as
                    pepos. Any small fleshy fruit is popularly called a berry, especially if it is edible.
                    Raspberries,
                    blackberries, and strawberries, for example, are not true berries but are aggregate
                    fruits—fruits
                    that consist of a number of smaller fruits. Cranberries and blueberries, however, are true
                    botanical
                    berries.)</p>

                <p>Part of what makes DGLVs so super is their potential to reduce your risk
                    of chronic illnesses including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. They also contain high levels
                    of anti-inflammatory compounds known as carotenoids, which may protect against certain types of
                    cancer (3Trusted Source). </p>
                <p>Like all non-starchy vegetables,dark green vegetables are low in calories and high in fiber.
                    High-fiber foods promote the feeling of fullness and help lower cholesterol by binding it in the
                    gastrointestinal tract and “escorting” it out with bowel movements. They also help promote bowel
                    movement regularity and help manage constipation, a common side effect of pregnancy.</p>
                <p>Also, high-fiber foods help control blood sugar by slowing the absorption of their naturally
                    occurring sugars into the blood stream. Blood sugar control is especially important for women
                    with or at risk for gestational diabetes. Dark green vegetables are good sources of vitamins A,
                    C, K and the B-vitamin folate, as well as the minerals iron and calcium.</p>
                <p>Half of what we eat should be a variety of non-starchy vegetables and fruit. Of this, it is
                    recommended that each week we eat a minimum of 1 1/2 cups of dark green vegetables. In general,
                    1 cup of raw or cooked vegetables or vegetable juice, or 2 cups of raw leafy greens can be
                    considered as 1 cup. Some well-known DGLVs include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kale</li>
                    <li>Swiss chard</li>
                    <li>Collard greens</li>
                    <li>Turnip greens</li>
                    <li>Spinach</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some DGLVs have a bitter taste and not everyone enjoys them plain. You can get creative by
                    including them in your favorite soups, salads, smoothies, stir-fries and curries. Great news
                    about greens - they are nutrient dense! That means they are low in calories and high in
                    nutrients. Leafy greens have about 10-35 calories per 125 mL (1/2 cup) cooked serving. They are
                    rich in folate, vitamin A, calcium and vitamin C. They also high in fibre, and naturally low in
                    fat and sodium.</p>

                <p>Whole eggs are rich in many nutrients including B vitamins, choline, selenium, vitamin A, iron
                    and
                    phosphorus. They’re also loaded with high-quality protein. Eggs contain two potent antioxidants,
                    zeaxanthin and lutein, which are known to protect vision and eye health. Despite fears
                    surrounding
                    egg consumption and high cholesterol, research indicates no measurable increase in heart disease
                    or
                    diabetes risk from eating up to 6–12 eggs per week. In fact, eating eggs could increase “good”
                    HDL
                    cholesterol in some people, which may lead to a favorable reduction in heart disease risk. More
                    research is needed to draw a definite conclusion. According to the United States Department of
                    Agriculture (USDA), one medium boiled or poached egg weighing 44 g can provide the following
                    nutrients:</p>
                <p>Eggs are a very good source of inexpensive, high-quality protein. More than half the protein of
                    an
                    egg is found in the egg white, which also includes vitamin B2 and lower amounts of fat than the
                    yolk. Eggs are rich sources of selenium, vitamin D, B6, B12 and minerals such as zinc, iron and
                    copper. Egg yolks contain more calories and fat than the whites. They are a source of
                    fat-soluble
                    vitamins A, D, E and K and lecithin, the compound that enables emulsification in recipes such as
                    hollandaise or mayonnaise.</p>
                <p>Some brands of egg now contain omega-3 fatty acids, depending on what the chickens have been fed
                    (always check the box). Eggs are regarded as a ‘complete’ source of protein as they contain all
                    nine
                    essential amino acids, the ones we cannot synthesise in our bodies and must obtain from our
                    diet.
                </p>
                <p>A study published in Paediatrics magazine has suggested that giving young children just one egg a
                    day
                    for six months, alongside a diet with reduced sugar-sweetened foods, may help them achieve a
                    healthy
                    height and prevent stunting.</p>
                <p>For years, eggs were considered more of a health risk than a healthy food. This is because they
                    were
                    considered a high-cholesterol food, so those with high cholesterol levels were advised to avoid
                    them. We now know that the cholesterol found in food has much less of an effect on our blood
                    cholesterol than the amount of saturated fat we eat. If you’ve been advised by your GP to change
                    your diet in an attempt to reduce your blood cholesterol levels, the best thing to do is to keep
                    to
                    daily guideline intakes for saturated fat (20g for the average woman and 30g for the average
                    man)
                    opting instead for monounsaturated fats found in olive and rapeseed oils. It’s also a good idea
                    to
                    increase your intake of vegetables, wholegrains, lean meats and low-fat dairy while minimising
                    sugars and refined carbs.</p>
                <p>Eggs are rich in several nutrients that promote heart health, such as betaine and choline. A
                    recent
                    study of nearly half a million people in China suggests that eating one egg a day may reduce the
                    risk of heart disease and stroke, although experts stress that eggs need to be consumed as part
                    of a
                    healthy lifestyle in order to be beneficial.</p>

            <article id="garlic" class="card">
                <h2 id="garlic">Garlic</h2>
                <img src="assets/image/garlic_2.png" class="featured-image" alt="Garlic">
                <img src="assets/image/garlic_1.png" class="inside-image" alt="Garlic">
                <p>Garlic is a popular culinary ingredient due to its distinct flavor, but it has also been used for
                    its
                    medicinal benefits for centuries. Research indicates that garlic may be effective in reducing
                    cholesterol and blood pressure, as well as supporting immune function. What’s more,
                    sulfur-containing compounds in garlic may even play a role in preventing certain types of
                    cancer.
                </p>
                <p>Fresh or crushed garlic yields the sulfur-containing compounds allicin, ajoene, diallyl
                    polysulfides,
                    vinyldithiins, S-allylcysteine, and enzymes, saponins, flavonoids, and Maillard reaction
                    products,
                    which are not sulfur-containing compounds. The phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor
                    of
                    garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping,
                    chewing,
                    or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing
                    compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol). The resultant compounds are responsible for the
                    sharp
                    or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to
                    react
                    over time. Among the members of the onion family, garlic has by far the highest concentrations
                    of
                    initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or leeks.
                    Although
                    many humans enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a
                    defensive
                    mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant. Because of
                    this, people throughout history have used garlic to keep away pests such as mosquitoes and slug.
                </p>
                <p>A large number of sulfur compounds contribute to the smell and taste of garlic. Allicin has been
                    found to be the compound most responsible for the hot sensation of raw garlic. This chemical
                    opens
                    thermo-transient receptor potential channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat
                    in
                    foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness. Allicin,
                    along
                    with its decomposition products diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, are major contributors
                    to
                    the characteristic odor of garlic, with other allicin-derived compounds, such as vinyldithiins
                    and
                    ajoene. Because of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the stinking rose. When eaten in
                    quantity, garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and garlic breath the following
                    day.
                    This is because garlic's strong-smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized, forming allyl methyl
                    sulfide. Allyl methyl sulfide (AMS) cannot be digested and is passed into the blood. It is
                    carried
                    to the lungs and the skin, where it is excreted. Since digestion takes several hours, and
                    release of
                    AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time.</p>
                <p>The well-known phenomenon of garlic breath is allegedly alleviated by eating fresh parsley. The
                    herb
                    is, therefore, included in many garlic recipes, such as pistou, persillade, and the garlic
                    butter
                    spread used in garlic bread. Because of the AMS in the bloodstream, it is believed by some to
                    act as
                    a mosquito repellent, but no clinically reported evidence suggests it is actually effective.
                    Abundant sulfur compounds in garlic are also responsible for turning garlic green or blue during
                    pickling and cooking. Under these conditions (i.e. acidity, heat) the sulfur-containing compound
                    alliin reacts with common amino acids to make pyrroles, clusters of carbon-nitrogen
                    rings.[31][32]
                    These rings can be linked together into polypyrrole molecules. Ring structures absorb particular
                    wavelengths of light and thus appear colored. The two-pyrrole molecule looks red, the
                    three-pyrrole
                    molecule looks blue, and the four-pyrrole molecule looks green (like chlorophyll, a
                    tetrapyrrole).
                    Like chlorophyll, the pyrrole pigments are safe to eat. Upon cutting, similar to a color change
                    in
                    onion caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds,[34] garlic can turn green</p>

                <p>Ginger root contains antioxidants, such as gingerol, that may be responsible for many of the
                    reported
                    health benefits associated with this food. Ginger may be effective for managing nausea and
                    reducing
                    pain from acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. It may also reduce your risk of chronic

                    gastrointestinal distress. In herbal medicine, ginger is regarded as an excellent carminative (a
                    substance which promotes the elimination of intestinal gas) and intestinal spasmolytic (a
                    substance
                    which relaxes and soothes the intestinal tract). Modern scientific research has revealed that
                    ginger
                    possesses numerous therapeutic properties including antioxidant effects, an ability to inhibit
                    the
                    formation of inflammatory compounds, and direct anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
                <p>Several studies have investigated ginger’s effects on the gasses that form in the intestinal
                    tract
                    during digestion. Some research indicates that enzymes in ginger can help the body break up and
                    expel this gas, providing relief from any discomfort. Ginger also appears to have beneficial
                    effects
                    on the enzymes trypsin and pancreatic lipase, which are important for digestion. In addition,
                    ginger
                    may help increase movement through the digestive tract, suggesting that it may relieve or
                    prevent
                    constipation.</p>
                <p>Some research indicates that ginger can help alleviate morning sickness and relieve nausea
                    following
                    cancer treatment. One small study from 2010 examined the effects of ginger root powder
                    supplements
                    on nausea in 60 children and young adults who underwent chemotherapy. The analysis showed that
                    the
                    supplement led to reduced nausea in most of the people who took it. Authors of a 2011 review of
                    studies arrived at similar conclusions. They reported that taking a divided daily dosage of
                    1,500
                    milligrams (mg) of ginger extract helped alleviate symptoms of nausea. They also called for
                    further
                    studies in humans to fully understand the effects of ginger on nausea and other gastrointestinal
                    issues</p>
                <p>Many people use ginger to help recover from a cold or the flu. However, the evidence supporting
                    this
                    remedy is mostly anecdotal. In 2013, researchers studied the effects of fresh and dried ginger
                    on
                    one respiratory virus in human cells. The results indicated that fresh ginger may help protect
                    the
                    respiratory system, while dried ginger did not have the same impact. Also in 2013, a small study
                    set
                    out to investigate the popularity of herbal medicine as a cold or flu treatment. After polling
                    300
                    pharmacy customers in two different locations, the researchers determined that 69% of those
                    polled
                    used herbal medicine and that most of this group found it effective. However, while ginger was
                    among
                    the most popular ingredients in these remedies, some of the participants may not have used it.

                <p>EGCG is likely what gives green tea its apparent ability to protect against chronic diseases
                    including heart disease, diabetes and cancer Research also indicates that the combination of
                    catechins and caffeine in green tea may make it an effective tool for weight loss in some people
                    Regular green tea is 99.9% water, provides 1 kcal per 100 mL serving, is devoid of significant
                    nutrient content (table) and contains phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and caffeine.</p>
                <p>Numerous claims have been made for the health benefits of green tea, but human clinical research
                    has
                    not found good evidence of benefit. In 2011, a panel of scientists published a report on the
                    claims
                    for health effects at the request of the European Commission: in general they found that the
                    claims
                    made for green tea were not supported by sufficient scientific evidence. Although green tea may
                    enhance mental alertness due to its caffeine content, there is only weak, inconclusive evidence
                    that
                    regular consumption of green tea affects the risk of cancer or cardiovascular diseases, and
                    there is
                    no evidence that it benefits weight loss. Although using green tea as a health supplement green
                    tea
                    is associated with a slight improvement in overall quality of life, it is also associated with
                    some
                    potential adverse effects. A 2020 review by the Cochrane Collaboration listed these as
                    gastrointestinal disorders, higher levels of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised
                    blood
                    pressure and skin reactions</p>
                <p>According to the National Cancer Institute, the polyphenols in tea have been shown to decrease
                    tumor
                    growth in laboratory and animal studies and may protect against damage caused by ultraviolet UVB
                    radiation. In countries where green tea consumption is high, cancer rates tend to be lower, but
                    it
                    is impossible to know for sure whether it is the green tea that prevents cancer in these
                    particular
                    populations or other lifestyle factors.</p>
                <p>A 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that green
                    tea
                    consumption is associated with reduced mortality due to all causes, including cardiovascular
                    disease. The study followed over 40,000 Japanese participants between the ages of 40 and 79 for
                    11
                    years, starting in 1994. The participants who drank at least 5 cups of green tea per day had a
                    significantly lower risk of dying (especially from cardiovascular disease) than those who drank
                    less
                    than one cup of tea per day.</p>
                <p>An analysis of published studies in 2011 found that consuming green tea, either as a beverage or
                    in
                    capsule form, was linked to significant but modest reductions in total and LDL or “bad”
                    cholesterol.
                </p>
                <p>Drinking green tea or coffee on a regular basis is associated with a reduced risk of stroke,
                    according to a study published in the journal Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association.
                    The
                    lead author of the study, Dr. Yoshihiro Kokubo, Ph.D., said, “This is the first large-scale
                    study to
                    examine the combined effects of both green tea and coffee on stroke risks. You may make a small
                    but
                    positive lifestyle change to help lower the risk of stroke by adding daily green tea to your

                <p>Kefir is similar to yogurt but has a thinner consistency and typically more probiotic strains
                    than
                    yogurt. Fermented, probiotic-rich foods like kefir have several associated health benefits,
                    including reduced cholesterol, lowered blood pressure, improved digestion and anti-inflammatory
                    effects. Though kefir is traditionally made from cow’s milk, it’s typically well tolerated by
                    people
                    with lactose intolerance due to the fermentation of the lactose by bacteria. However, it’s also
                    made
                    from non-dairy beverages such as coconut milk, rice milk and coconut water. You can purchase
                    kefir
                    or make it yourself. If you’re choosing a commercially prepared product, be mindful of added
                    sugar
                </p>
                <p>Yogurt is a popular dairy product that's made by the bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria
                    used to make yogurt are called "yogurt cultures," which ferment lactose, the natural sugar found
                    in
                    milk. This process produces lactic acid, a substance that causes milk proteins to curdle, giving
                    yogurt its unique flavor and texture. Yogurt can be made from all types of milk. Varieties made
                    from
                    skim milk are considered fat-free, whereas those made from whole milk are considered full-fat.
                    Plain
                    yogurt without added colorants is a white, thick liquid with a tangy flavor. Unfortunately, most
                    commercial brands contain added ingredients, such as sugar and artificial flavors. These yogurts
                    are
                    not good for your health. On the other hand, plain, unsweetened yogurt offers many health
                    benefits.
                </p>
                <p>Less is more when it comes to choosing a healthy yogurt. Plain, unsweetened varieties are best,
                    since
                    they contain minimal ingredients without any added sugar. Whether you choose low- or full-fat
                    yogurt
                    is a personal choice. Full-fat varieties contain more calories, but that doesn't mean that
                    they're
                    unhealthy. Just make sure to stick with the recommended portion size. You should also look for
                    yogurts that contain live and active cultures to ensure you get your fix of health-promoting
                    probiotics.</p>
                <p>Whether yogurt is a healthful choice depends on the person consuming it and the type of yogurt.
                    Yogurts can be high in protein, calcium, vitamins, and live culture, or probiotics, which can
                    enhance the gut microbiota. These can offer protection for bones and teeth and help prevent
                    digestive problems. Low-fat yogurt can be a useful source of protein on a weight-loss diet.
                    Probiotics may boost the immune system.</p>

                <p>They earn the superfood label because they’re loaded with nutrients and play a role in preventing
                    and
                    managing various diseases. Legumes are a rich source of B vitamins, various minerals, protein
                    and
                    fiber. Research indicates that they offer many health benefits including improved type 2
                    diabetes
                    management, as well as reduced blood pressure and cholesterol.</p>
                <p>Eating beans and legumes regularly may also promote healthy weight maintenance, due to their
                    ability
                    to improve feelings of fullness. Legumes are a good source of protein, iron, and zinc typically
                    found in animal products such as chicken or beef. They also are high in fiber, folate, and
                    potassium. For example, 1 serving (1/4 cup) of legumes provides 20 percent of the daily
                    recommended
                    amount of fiber for adults.</p>
                <p>In addition, lignans, saponins, flavonoids, and sterols are phytochemicals in legumes that are
                    associated with a lower risk of cancer. Other data show that bacteria in the digestive tract
                    feed on
                    fiber, which produces compounds that may protect cells of the colon. Because legumes contain
                    insoluble fiber that slow digestion and release carbohydrate more gradually that some other
                    foods,
                    they tend to help keep blood sugar levels even. A study of 121 people with type 2 diabetes
                    showed
                    that consuming 1 cup of legumes each day as part of a lower glycemic index diet lowered blood
                    sugar
                    levels. For these reasons, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) lists legumes among the top
                    10
                    superfoods for people with diabetes</p>
                <p>One of the main advantages of legumes is that they don't contain much saturated fat, unlike red
                    meat.
                    Saturated fat in high amounts may contribute to cardiovascular disease, so experts recommend
                    limiting intake to 20 grams per day for a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, less if your calorie intake
                    is
                    lower. But legumes are a great choice based not only on what they lack, but what they contain.
                    Legumes are a good source of plant protein — half a cup of cooked beans provides between 6 and 9
                    grams — and they're packed with other nutrients, such as folate, calcium, potassium, zinc, B
                    vitamins, and antioxidants. They also contain lots of fiber, which can help you avoid
                    constipation
                    and may reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
                <p>If you didn't grow up eating beans, you may not know where to start when it comes to adding them
                    to
                    your diet. Consult the experts. "There are a ton of really good vegetarian cookbooks that
                    include
                    wonderful different bean dishes," says Dr. Stampfer. "People often think of beans only as a bowl
                    of
                    baked beans, but there is really so much more you can do with them."</p>
                <p>Beans typically come dried, canned, or frozen, and they can be easily added to many dishes you
                    probably already eat. For example, chickpeas and other types of beans can be slipped into soups
                    and
                    pasta or blended into a creamy hummus dip for fresh vegetables. Trade the beef in your burrito
                    for
                    beans, or skip your usual roast beef sandwich and opt for peanut butter instead. Grab a handful
                    of
                    peanuts as a quick snack and even add some beans into your breakfast by mixing them into your
                    breakfast of scrambled eggs along with some chopped vegetables.</p>

                <p>Nuts and seeds make up an important part of a healthy diet. Both types of food help you reach
                    your
                    recommended intake of protein each day, as well as count toward your daily fat allowance. Seeds
                    and
                    nuts benefit your health because they offer key essential nutrients and play a role in disease
                    prevention by keeping you healthy as you age.</p>
                <p>Nuts and seeds benefit your health by providing a source of dietary fiber. Fiber is a specialized
                    type of carbohydrate found in plant-based foods. It does not break down as it passes through
                    your
                    digestive tract, and the undigested fiber adds bulk to your stool to promote regular bowel
                    movements. Fiber also helps slow the rate of digestion. This means that sugar from your meal
                    enters
                    your bloodstream slowly, leading to a gradual rise in blood sugar that leaves you feeling
                    energized
                    after you eat. Opt for flax seeds as an excellent source of fiber -- an ounce of the seeds
                    contains
                    a whopping 7.7 grams. An ounce of almonds boosts your fiber intake by 3.5 grams, while sunflower
                    seeds contain 3.1 grams of fiber per ounce. An equivalent an serving of pistachios and pecans
                    offers
                    2.9 and 2.7 grams, respectively.</p>
                <p>Nuts and seeds also pack various plant compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
                    properties,
                    which can protect against oxidative stress. Research indicates that eating nuts and seeds can
                    have a
                    protective effect against heart disease. Common nuts and seeds include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Almonds, pecans, pistachios, walnuts, cashews, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts</li>
                    <li>Peanuts — technically a legume, but often considered a nut</li>
                    <li>Sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, flaxseeds, hemp seeds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Interestingly, even though nuts and seeds are calorically dense, some types of nuts are linked to

                <p>It’s biggest claims to health are its high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and
                    polyphenolic compounds. Adding olive oil to your diet may reduce inflammation and your risk of
                    certain illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. It also contains antioxidants such as
                    vitamins
                    E and K, which can protect against cellular damage from oxidative stress.\n\n" + Limited and not
                    conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about 2 tbsp. (23 g) of olive oil daily may
                    reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the monounsaturated fat in olive oil. To
                    achieve
                    this possible benefit, olive oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not

                    the total number of calories you eat in a day Many studies have looked at the health benefits of
                    olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil, which is the best quality oil available, is rich in
                    antioxidants,
                    which help prevent cellular damage caused by molecules called free radicals.</p>
                <p>Free radicals are substances that the body produces during metabolism and other processes.
                    Antioxidants neutralize free radicals.\n\n" + If too many free radicals build up, they can cause
                    oxidative stress. This can lead to cell damage, and it may play a role in the development of
                    certain
                    diseases, including certain types of cancer. Olive oil is the main source of fat in the
                    Mediterranean diet. People who consume this diet appear to have a higher life expectancy,
                    including
                    a lower chance of dying from cardiovascular diseases, compared with people who follow other
                    diets.
                    Some experts call it “the standard in preventive medicine. A 2018 study compared the number of
                    cardiovascular events among people who consumed a Mediterranean diet, either with olive oil or
                    nuts,
                    or a low-fat diet. People who consumed the Mediterranean diet, whether with olive oil or nuts,
                    had a
                    lower incidence of cardiovascular disease than those on the low-fat diet.</p>
                <p>According to the authors of one 2018 review, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the
                    European
                    Food Safety Authority recommend consuming around 20 grams (g) or two tablespoons (tbs) of extra
                    virgin olive oil each day to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation. Results
                    of
                    a 2017 study suggested that the polyphenols in extra virgin olive oil may offer protection from
                    cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, stroke, brain dysfunction, and cancer. Polyphenols are
                    a
                    type of antioxidant. Metabolic syndrome is a condition characterized by a group of risk factors
                    that
                    increase disease risk, including obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar levels.
                    Authors
                    of a 2019 meta-analysis concluded that olive oil in a Mediterranean diet might improve features
                    of
                    metabolic syndrome, such as inflammation, blood sugar, triglycerides (fats in the blood), and
                    low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol. In contrast, it appears to increase levels
                    of
                    high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good” cholesterol</p>
